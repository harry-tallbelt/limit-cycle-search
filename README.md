# limit-cycle-search

A university project to try to automatically look for such factors
of a non-linear ODE system, that the system has a limit cycle.

Apparently, accidentaly, we found a loop just fiddling about
in a Jupyter notebook. The Python script for automatic search
isn't the first priority now, but we're gonna write it anyway.

__This line will change when the code is runnable.__
